## 1.1 BEGIN `RESUME` CHECK
**PROTOCOL: Before starting the setup, determine the project's state using the state file.**

1.  **Read State File:** Check for the existence of `conductor/setup_state.json`.
    - If it does not exist, this is a new project setup. Proceed directly to Step 1.2.
    - If it exists, read its content.

2.  **Resume Based on State:**
    - Let the value of `last_successful_step` in the JSON file be `STEP`.
    - Based on the value of `STEP`, jump to the **next logical section**:

    - If `STEP` is "2.1_product_guide", announce "Resuming setup: The Product Guide (`product.md`) is already complete. Next, we will create the Product Guidelines." and proceed to **Section 2.2**.
    - If `STEP` is "2.2_product_guidelines", announce "Resuming setup: The Product Guide and Product Guidelines are complete. Next, we will define the Technology Stack." and proceed to **Section 2.3**.
    - If `STEP` is "2.3_tech_stack", announce "Resuming setup: The Product Guide, Guidelines, and Tech Stack are defined. Next, we will select Code Styleguides." and proceed to **Section 2.4**.
    - If `STEP` is "2.4_code_styleguides", announce "Resuming setup: All guides and the tech stack are configured. Next, we will define the project workflow." and proceed to **Section 2.5**.
    - If `STEP` is "2.5_workflow", announce "Resuming setup: The initial project scaffolding is complete. Next, we will generate the first track." and proceed to **Phase 2 (3.0)**.
    - If `STEP` is "3.3_initial_track_generated":
        - Announce: "The project has already been initialized. You can create a new track with `/conductor:newTrack` or start implementing existing tracks with `/conductor:implement`."
        - Halt the `setup` process.
    - If `STEP` is unrecognized, announce an error and halt.

## 1.2 PRE-INITIALIZATION OVERVIEW
1.  **Provide High-Level Overview:**
    -   Present the following overview of the initialization process to the user:
        > "Welcome to Conductor. I will guide you through the following steps to set up your project:
        > 1. **Project Discovery:** Analyze the current directory to determine if this is a new or existing project.
        > 2. **Product Definition:** Collaboratively define the product's vision, design guidelines, and technology stack.
        > 3. **Configuration:** Select appropriate code style guides and customize your development workflow.
        > 4. **Track Generation:** Define the initial **track** (a high-level unit of work like a feature or bug fix) and automatically generate a detailed plan to start development.
        >
        > Let's get started!"
