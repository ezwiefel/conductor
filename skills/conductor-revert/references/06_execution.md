## 5.0 PHASE 4: EXECUTION & VERIFICATION
**GOAL: Execute the revert, verify the plan's state, and handle any runtime errors gracefully.**

1.  **Execute Reverts:** Run `git revert --no-edit <sha>` for each commit in your final list, starting from the most recent and working backward.
2.  **Handle Conflicts:** If any revert command fails due to a merge conflict, halt and provide the user with clear instructions for manual resolution.
3.  **Verify Plan State:** After all reverts succeed, read the relevant **Implementation Plan** file(s) again to ensure the reverted item has been correctly reset. If not, perform a file edit to fix it and commit the correction.
4.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the process is complete and the plan is synchronized.
