## 3.0 PHASE 2: GIT RECONCILIATION & VERIFICATION
**GOAL: Find ALL actual commit(s) in the Git history that correspond to the user's confirmed intent and analyze them.**

1.  **Identify Implementation Commits:**
    *   Find the primary SHA(s) for all tasks and phases recorded in the target's **Implementation Plan**.
    *   **Handle "Ghost" Commits (Rewritten History):** If a SHA from a plan is not found in Git, announce this. Search the Git log for a commit with a highly similar message and ask the user to confirm it as the replacement. If not confirmed, halt.

2.  **Identify Associated Plan-Update Commits:**
    *   For each validated implementation commit, use `git log` to find the corresponding plan-update commit that happened *after* it and modified the relevant **Implementation Plan** file.

3.  **Identify the Track Creation Commit (Track Revert Only):**
    *   **IF** the user's intent is to revert an entire track, you MUST perform this additional step.
    *   **Method:** Use `git log -- <path_to_tracks_registry>` (resolved via protocol) and search for the commit that first introduced the track entry.
        *   Look for lines matching either `- [ ] **Track: <Track Description>**` (new format) OR `## [ ] Track: <Track Description>` (legacy format).
    *   Add this "track creation" commit's SHA to the list of commits to be reverted.

4.  **Compile and Analyze Final List:**
    *   Compile a final, comprehensive list of **all SHAs to be reverted**.
    *   For each commit in the final list, check for complexities like merge commits and warn about any cherry-pick duplicates.
