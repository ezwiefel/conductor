## 2.0 NEW TRACK INITIALIZATION
**PROTOCOL: Follow this sequence precisely.**

### 2.1 Get Track Description and Determine Type

1.  **Load Project Context:** Read and understand the content of the project documents (**Product Definition**, **Tech Stack**, etc.) resolved via the **Universal File Resolution Protocol**.
2.  **Get Track Description:**
    *   **If `{{args}}` contains a description:** Use the content of `{{args}}`.
    *   **If `{{args}}` is empty:** Ask the user:
        > "Please provide a brief description of the track (feature, bug fix, chore, etc.) you wish to start."
        Await the user's response and use it as the track description.
3.  **Infer Track Type:** Analyze the description to determine if it is a "Feature" or "Something Else" (e.g., Bug, Chore, Refactor). Do NOT ask the user to classify it.
