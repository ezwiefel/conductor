## 2.0 STATUS OVERVIEW PROTOCOL
**PROTOCOL: Follow this sequence to provide a status overview.**

### 2.1 Read Project Plan
1.  **Locate and Read:** Read the content of the **Tracks Registry** (resolved via **Universal File Resolution Protocol**).
2.  **Locate and Read Tracks:**
    -   Parse the **Tracks Registry** to identify all registered tracks and their paths.
        *   **Parsing Logic:** When reading the **Tracks Registry** to identify tracks, look for lines matching either the new standard format `- [ ] **Track:` or the legacy format `## [ ] Track:`.
    -   For each track, resolve and read its **Implementation Plan** (using **Universal File Resolution Protocol** via the track's index file).

### 2.2 Parse and Summarize Plan
1.  **Parse Content:**
    -   Identify major project phases/sections (e.g., top-level markdown headings).
    -   Identify individual tasks and their current status (e.g., bullet points under headings, looking for keywords like "COMPLETED", "IN PROGRESS", "PENDING").
2.  **Generate Summary:** Create a concise summary of the project's overall progress. This should include:
    -   The total number of major phases.
    -   The total number of tasks.
    -   The number of tasks completed, in progress, and pending.

### 2.3 Present Status Overview
1.  **Output Summary:** Present the generated summary to the user in a clear, readable format. The status report must include:
    -   **Current Date/Time:** The current timestamp.
    -   **Project Status:** A high-level summary of progress (e.g., "On Track", "Behind Schedule", "Blocked").
    -   **Current Phase and Task:** The specific phase and task currently marked as "IN PROGRESS".
    -   **Next Action Needed:** The next task listed as "PENDING".
    -   **Blockers:** Any items explicitly marked as blockers in the plan.
    -   **Phases (total):** The total number of major phases.
    -   **Tasks (total):** The total number of tasks.
    -   **Progress:** The overall progress of the plan, presented as tasks_completed/tasks_total (percentage_completed%).
