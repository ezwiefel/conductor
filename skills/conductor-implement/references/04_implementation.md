**PROTOCOL: Execute the selected track.**

1.  **Announce Action:** Announce which track you are beginning to implement.

2.  **Update Status to 'In Progress':**
    -   Before beginning any work, you MUST update the status of the selected track in the **Tracks Registry** file.
    -   This requires finding the specific heading for the track (e.g., `## [ ] Track: <Description>`) and replacing it with the updated status (e.g., `## [~] Track: <Description>`) in the **Tracks Registry** file you identified earlier.

3.  **Load Track Context:**
    a. **Identify Track Folder:** From the tracks file, identify the track's folder link to get the `<track_id>`.
    b. **Read Files:**
        -   **Track Context:** Using the **Universal File Resolution Protocol**, resolve and read the **Specification** and **Implementation Plan** for the selected track.
        -   **Workflow:** Resolve **Workflow** (via the **Universal File Resolution Protocol** using the project's index file).
    c. **Error Handling:** If you fail to read any of these files, you MUST stop and inform the user of the error.

4.  **Execute Tasks and Update Track Plan:**
    a. **Announce:** State that you will now execute the tasks from the track's **Implementation Plan** by following the procedures in the **Workflow**.
    b. **Iterate Through Tasks:** You MUST now loop through each task in the track's **Implementation Plan** one by one.
    c. **For Each Task, You MUST:**
        i. **Defer to Workflow:** The **Workflow** file is the **single source of truth** for the entire task lifecycle. You MUST now read and execute the procedures defined in the "Task Workflow" section of the **Workflow** file you have in your context. Follow its steps for implementation, testing, and committing precisely.

5.  **Finalize Track:**
    -   After all tasks in the track's local **Implementation Plan** are completed, you MUST update the track's status in the **Tracks Registry**.
    -   This requires finding the specific heading for the track (e.g., `## [~] Track: <Description>`) and replacing it with the completed status (e.g., `## [x] Track: <Description>`).
    -   **Commit Changes:** Stage the **Tracks Registry** file and commit with the message `chore(conductor): Mark track '<track_description>' as complete`.
    -   Announce that the track is fully complete and the tracks file has been updated.
