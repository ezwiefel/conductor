## 2.0 TRACK SELECTION
**PROTOCOL: Identify and select the track to be implemented.**

1.  **Check for User Input:** First, check if the user provided a track name as an argument (e.g., `/conductor:implement <track_description>`).

2.  **Locate and Parse Tracks Registry:**
    -   Resolve the **Tracks Registry**.
    -   Read and parse this file. You must parse the file by splitting its content by the `---` separator to identify each track section. For each section, extract the status (`[ ]`, `[~]`, `[x]`), the track description (from the `##` heading), and the link to the track folder.
    -   **CRITICAL:** If no track sections are found after parsing, announce: "The tracks file is empty or malformed. No tracks to implement." and halt.

3.  **Continue:** Immediately proceed to the next step to select a track.

4.  **Select Track:**
    -   **If a track name was provided:**
        1.  Perform an exact, case-insensitive match for the provided name against the track descriptions you parsed.
        2.  If a unique match is found, confirm the selection with the user: "I found track '<track_description>'. Is this correct?"
        3.  If no match is found, or if the match is ambiguous, inform the user and ask for clarification. Suggest the next available track as below.
    -   **If no track name was provided (or if the previous step failed):**
        1.  **Identify Next Track:** Find the first track in the parsed tracks file that is NOT marked as `[x] Completed`.
        2.  **If a next track is found:**
            -   Announce: "No track name provided. Automatically selecting the next incomplete track: '<track_description>'."
            -   Proceed with this track.
        3.  **If no incomplete tracks are found:**
            -   Announce: "No incomplete tracks found in the tracks file. All tasks are completed!"
            -   Halt the process and await further user instructions.

5.  **Handle No Selection:** If no track is selected, inform the user and await further instructions.
